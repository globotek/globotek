        <p class="faq__body__content">We will contact you to introduce ourselves and request credentials to your  site so that  we can make a copy of your live site. Then, we will create a sub-domain on globotek.net where the clone of your live site will live. Each month, we will synchronise our version to the live site so weâ€™re working on the latest version. Once updates are completed in the safety of our copy, your live site will be updated.</p>
